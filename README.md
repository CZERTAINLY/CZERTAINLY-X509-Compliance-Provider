X509 Compliance Provider is the implementation of compliance check and management for x509 certificates that are managed by CZERTAINLY. This `Connector` performs compliance check for the certificates of type x509. List of items to be considered to determine the compliance of a certificate is administrated by the rules and groups.

### Rules

### Groups

X509 Compliance Provider allows you to perform the following operations:
- Check compliance of x509 Certificate

## Database requirements

This `Connector` does not require any database as it does not persist any data.

## Short Process Description

Compliance of the certificate is calculated by the use of `Compliance Profiles`. `Compliance Profiles` are the entities that holds the list of rules and groups to be considered for the compliance calculation. These objects holds rules and groups from different `Connectors`, apply them accordingly and compute the status based on the rule validations.

X509 Compliance Provider consumes ZLint for some rules and groups. To know more about ZLint, refer to [ZLint](https://github.com/zmap/zlint)
